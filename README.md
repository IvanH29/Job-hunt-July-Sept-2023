## Analysis of a 2+ Months Job Search Process

Over the past 2 months, I have been immersed in a job search process during which I applied to a total of 105 positions. My focus has been divided between roles in Data Analytics and Customer Service. In this analysis, I will explore the outcomes and challenges I have encountered in each of these domains.

### Data Analytics Roles

Within the realm of Data Analytics, I have submitted applications to 79 opportunities. Out of these applications, 65 have gone unanswered, highlighting an area for improvement in terms of employer communication. Furthermore, of the remaining applications, 14 have resulted in rejections. This underscores the need to continue enhancing my skills and experience to align with market requirements.

### Customer Service Roles

In the field of Customer Service, I have directed my efforts towards 26 opportunities. Out of these, 19 have received no response from employers, showcasing a similar challenge in bidirectional communication. Despite this, I have received responses from 7 applications. However, these responses have varied: 5 applications have culminated in rejections, while 2 have demonstrated a higher degree of interaction.

Out of the 2 applications with which I progressed in the selection process, one provided me with the opportunity for a second interview but ultimately resulted in a rejection. The other application also advanced to a second interview, but unfortunately, after that stage, there was no further follow-up.

To visually depict these dynamics, I have created a Sankey diagram that represents the flow of applications and responses in both fields. However, due to GitHub's inability to render interactive Plotly graphics, I have kept the diagram in static format. Although it cannot be interacted with directly, it offers an overview of the process and the fluctuations between key stages.

I hope this analysis provides a deeper understanding of my job search experience and underscores the importance of communication and continuous improvement in this process.
